/**
 * The artwork colour field, on the GPU.
 *
 * Three ideas stacked, none of them a blur filter:
 *
 * 1. **Extreme downscale is the blur.** The cover is drawn into a canvas a few
 *    dozen pixels wide and uploaded as a texture with linear filtering. Scaling
 *    those handful of pixels back up to the window *is* the softening — the
 *    hardware interpolates between them for free. A real gaussian over a
 *    full-size image costs orders of magnitude more for a blurrier result.
 * 2. **A noise warp is the motion.** A static wash reads as a photo behind
 *    glass. Displacing the texture coordinates with value noise that evolves
 *    over time makes the colours flow into each other instead.
 * 3. **Two textures are the crossfade.** The outgoing artwork stays resident
 *    while the incoming one loads, and the shader mixes between them, so a
 *    track change dissolves rather than cuts.
 *
 * Everything is sampled through the same warped coordinate, so the two
 * artworks flow as one field rather than as two images fading past each other.
